event: Bankruptcy
question:  |
  What is Bankruptcy and if it is for you 
subquestion:  |
 Advantages of going bankrupt:
 
   1. When the bankruptcy order is over you can make a fresh start - in most cases this will be after a year.

   2. the pressure is taken off you because you don’t have to deal with your creditors
  you're allowed to keep certain things known as 'exempt goods', for example everyday household items, tools you need to do your job, a car if you need it to get to work or you're a carer and it's not worth more than £2,000
  
   3. you're allowed to keep some of your income - but you'll probably have to live on less money than usual
   
   4. if you have to make payments from your income, this can only be for 3 years - you won’t have to make payments if your only income is from welfare benefits
   
   5. creditors have to stop most types of court action to get their money back following a bankruptcy order

   6. you won't have to pay back the debts that bankruptcy covers
 
 Things you need to watch out when apply:
  
  1.	You may lose your home if you have any equity available (by title or beneficial interest).
  2.	You may be asked to sell your car or trade down for a less expensive model.
  3.	Until your bankruptcy is discharged you may find it difficult to obtain, or change, a mortgage.
  4.	Some professional bodies, such as chartered accountants or solicitors, may have rules prohibiting membership and you cannot enlist in the armed forces as an undischarged Bankrupt.
  5.	The court may enforce an ‘income payments order’ for three years if it deems it necessary.
  6.	Your credit rating will be affected
  7.  The cost of bankruptcy is high (680 pounds)
  
  Check if it is for you?
    
    1. For bankruptcy, you might need to sell you house, you said **${home_will}**
    
    2. For banruptcy, the cost is relatively high(£680), you said **${cost_will}**
    
    3. Banruptcy will affect your credit rating, you said **${credit_will}**

event: Debt Relief Order
question:  |
  What is Debt relief order and is it for you  
subquestion:  |
 
  A debt relief order (DRO) is one way to deal with your debts if you:

    -owe £30,000 or less
    
    -don’t own your own home
    
    -don’t have other assets or things of value
    
    -don’t have much spare income 
    
     You don't have to make payments towards most types of debt included in your DRO and your creditors can’t force you to pay off the debts. A DRO usually lasts **a year** unless your situation improves. When the DRO ends, most of your debts will be **written off**.
     
     **Debts covered by a DRO:**
      
     Debts that can go into a DRO are called ’qualifying debts'. During the DRO period creditors can’t ask you for payments, if they do, you don't have to pay them. They include:

  credit cards, overdrafts and loans, arrears with rent, utility bills, telephone bills, council tax and income tax, benefits overpayments, hire purchase or conditional sale agreements, buy now - pay later agreements, bills for services like vets or solicitors, debts you owe to friends and family, business debts
     
     **Debts not covered by a DRO:**
     
     Not all debts are covered by a DRO. You'll still need to pay:

  -magistrates court fines and confiscation orders relating to criminal activity
  
  -child support and maintenance
  
  -student loans
  
  -social fund loans
  
  -compensation for death and injury
  
  **Is DRO right for you:**
  
    
    1. For DRO, the cost is relatively low(£90), you said **${cost_will}**
    
    2. DRO will affect your credit rating for 6 years, you said  **${credit_will}**
  
    3. it might affect applications you make for British citizenship - if you are unsure then you should get advice from an immigration specialist
    
    4. you can't borrow £500 or more without telling the creditor about the DRO, you can’t get involved in promoting, managing or setting up a limited company, or be a company director, without getting permission from the court
    
    **How to get a DRO?**
    
    You can only apply for a DRO through a specialist DRO adviser, also called an 'approved intermediary'. This is usually a skilled debt adviser who has been given permission to complete the forms and give advice on DROs. They will check that you're eligible to apply and that a DRO is right for you.

event: Administration Order 
question:  |
  What is an administration order and is it for you?
subquestion:  |
  **What is an administration order?**
  
  An administration order is a formal, legal debt solution which means it's approved by the court and your creditors have to stick to it. It requires two or more debts, yout debts no more than 5000 pounds in total, and a court judgement, if you don’t have a county court judgment or high court judgment, you need to wait for one of your creditors to take court action against you. As soon as judgment is entered you can apply for an administration order.
  
  **What debts administration order include?**
  
  The law does not specifically exclude any particular debt from an AO and when you apply for an AO, you must list all your debts in the application. However, any creditor can object to being included. It is up to the district judge to decide if any debts are left out.

  If a debt is left out, it still counts towards the £5,000 total.
  
  **Is it right for you?**
  Here are the quick comparision:
  
   |Requirment | Your situation|
   |-----------|----------|
   |at least 2 debts | ${len(debt)} debt     |
   | max £5,000 debt       |£${debt_total}       |
   | one of your debts is a county court or high court judgment       |${is_court_debt}      |
   |you have a regular income with some spare income each month| £${month_disposble_income } disposable income|
   | you don't want to have to deal with your creditors directly| ${change_creditor} |
  
 
  
  1. There is no up front fee for AO, The court keeps 10% of your monthly payment to cover their costs, you said your you said **${cost_will}**
   2. Administration orders are entered on the Register of Judgments, Orders and Fines and stay on the register for six years. This information also appears on your credit file. When the administration order ends, the court will change the record on the register to say the administration order has been paid off. Your perference **${credit_will}**
   3. If you are a home owner, you wont be expected to sell it or remortgage it to pay into your administration order. It will be safe. However some courts will not grant an administration order to home owners or people with a mortgage – you will need to check the practice of your local court.

event: Individual Voluntary Arrangement 
question:  |
  What is Individual Voluntary Arrangement(IVA) and is it for you?
subquestion:  |
  **What is IVA?**
  
    An individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) is a formal and legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to pay back your debts over a period of time. This means it’s approved by the court and your creditors have to stick to it.
    
    An IVA can be flexible to suit your needs but it can be expensive. An IVA must be set up by a qualified person, called an insolvency practitioner. This will be a lawyer or an accountant.The insolvency practitioner will charge fees for the IVA. These can often be high and are based on the amount you pay back through the IVA. If you decide to get an IVA, you will work out a repayment plan with the insolvency practitioner. This could be monthly payments, a lump sum or a combination of both.
    
    **Is this right for you?**
    
    1. your debts should be to more than £10000 or more, as the cost of IVA usually high, you said **${cost_will}**
    
    2. If you own a home, most IVA agreements include a requirement for you to get a valuation of your home in the final year. If there is equity in the property, you'll usually need to raise a lump sum to put into the IVA by re-mortgaging your home. Equity is the money you'd make from the sale of a property, after any mortgage or secured loans are paid off. You shouldn't have to sell your home to raise the lump sum. If you think you are being asked to sell your home, get specialist advice straight away. you preference on house is **${home_will}**
    
    3. Having an IVA may affect any future income or assets that you receive. For example, if you decide to move house while you have an IVA, any money you make from the sale may have to be paid into the IVA. yous said: **${change_will}**
