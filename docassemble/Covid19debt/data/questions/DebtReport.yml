event: Bankruptcy
question:  |
  What is Bankruptcy and if it is for you 
subquestion:  |
 Advantages of going bankrupt:
 
   1. When the bankruptcy order is over you can make a fresh start - in most cases this will be after a year.

   2. the pressure is taken off you because you don’t have to deal with your creditors
  you're allowed to keep certain things known as 'exempt goods', for example everyday household items, tools you need to do your job, a car if you need it to get to work or you're a carer and it's not worth more than £2,000
  
   3. you're allowed to keep some of your income - but you'll probably have to live on less money than usual
   
   4. if you have to make payments from your income, this can only be for 3 years - you won’t have to make payments if your only income is from welfare benefits
   
   5. creditors have to stop most types of court action to get their money back following a bankruptcy order

   6. you won't have to pay back the debts that bankruptcy covers
 
 Things you need to watch out when apply:
  
  1.	You may lose your home if you have any equity available (by title or beneficial interest).
  2.	You may be asked to sell your car or trade down for a less expensive model.
  3.	Until your bankruptcy is discharged you may find it difficult to obtain, or change, a mortgage.
  4.	Some professional bodies, such as chartered accountants or solicitors, may have rules prohibiting membership and you cannot enlist in the armed forces as an undischarged Bankrupt.
  5.	The court may enforce an ‘income payments order’ for three years if it deems it necessary.
  6.	Your credit rating will be affected
  7.  The cost of bankruptcy is high (680 pounds)
  
  Check if it is for you?
    
    1. For bankruptcy, you might need to sell you house, you said **${home_will}**
    
    2. For banruptcy, the cost is relatively high(£680), you said **${cost_will}**
    
    3. Banruptcy will affect your credit rating, you said **${credit_will}**

event: Debt Relief Order
question:  |
  What is Debt relief order and is it for you  
subquestion:  |
 
  A debt relief order (DRO) is one way to deal with your debts if you:

    -owe £30,000 or less
    
    -don’t own your own home
    
    -don’t have other assets or things of value
    
    -don’t have much spare income 
    
     You don't have to make payments towards most types of debt included in your DRO and your creditors can’t force you to pay off the debts. A DRO usually lasts **a year** unless your situation improves. When the DRO ends, most of your debts will be **written off**.
     
     **Debts covered by a DRO:**

  -magistrates court fines and confiscation orders relating to criminal activity
  
  -child support and maintenance
  
  -student loans
  
  -social fund loans

event: Individual Voluntary Arrangement 
question:  |
  What is Individual Voluntary Arrangement(IVA) and is it for you?
subquestion:  |
  **What is IVA?**
  
    An individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) is a formal and legally binding agreement between you and your creditors to pay back your debts over a period of time. This means it’s approved by the court and your creditors have to stick to it.
    
    An IVA can be flexible to suit your needs but it can be expensive. An IVA must be set up by a qualified person, called an insolvency practitioner. This will be a lawyer or an accountant.The insolvency practitioner will charge fees for the IVA. These can often be high and are based on the amount you pay back through the IVA. If you decide to get an IVA, you will work out a repayment plan with the insolvency practitioner. This could be monthly payments, a lump sum or a combination of both.
    
    **Is this right for you?**
    
    1. your debts should be to more than £10000 or more, as the cost of IVA usually high, you said **${cost_will}**
    
    2. If you own a home, most IVA agreements include a requirement for you to get a valuation of your home in the final year. If there is equity in the property, you'll usually need to raise a lump sum to put into the IVA by re-mortgaging your home. Equity is the money you'd make from the sale of a property, after any mortgage or secured loans are paid off. You shouldn't have to sell your home to raise the lump sum. If you think you are being asked to sell your home, get specialist advice straight away. you preference on house is **${home_will}**
    
    3. Having an IVA may affect any future income or assets that you receive. For example, if you decide to move house while you have an IVA, any money you make from the sale may have to be paid into the IVA. yous said: **${change_will}**
