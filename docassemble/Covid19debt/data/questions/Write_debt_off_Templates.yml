  If you are unable to pay your debts, you should contact your creditor to let them know and see if they are willing to write off the debt.
  
  To help you with this, we've created a set of letter templates which you can use to write to your non-priority creditors. 
  
  Debts owed to non-priority creditors are things like credit card debts, overdrafts and other unsecured loans. 
  
  The letter templates help you to write to creditors in different situations. You can't change the main text of the letters but you can add your own details like your name, address and the reasons why you can't pay the money.
