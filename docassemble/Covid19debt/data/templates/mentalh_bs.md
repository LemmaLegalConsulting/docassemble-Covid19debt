A mental health crisis breathing space is only available to someone who is receiving mental health crisis treatment and it has some stronger protections. It lasts as long as the person's mental health crisis treatment, plus 30 days (no matter how long the crisis treatment lasts).

The government committed to develop an alternative route to access the protections for people receiving mental health crisis treatment, so that they do not have to access debt advice first. If an Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP) certifies that a person is receiving mental health crisis treatment, the AMHP’s evidence can be used by a debt adviser to start a mental health crisis breathing space.

In addition to the debtor, the following people can apply to a debt adviser on behalf of a debtor for a mental health crisis breathing space:
 
 - any debtor receiving mental health
  - the debtor’s carer
  - Approved Mental Health Professionals
  - care co-ordinators appointed for the debtor
  - mental health nurses
  - social workers
  - independent mental health advocates or mental capacity advocates appointed for the debtor
  - a debtor’s representative
  
#####Debtor eligibility for a mental health crisis breathing space

 The debtor must still meet the same criteria and conditions for a standard breathing space, but they must also be receiving mental health crisis treatment at the time that an application is made. A debtor who has had a standard or mental health crisis breathing space in the last 12 months may be eligible for a mental health crisis breathing space.

 there is no limit to how many times a debtor can enter a mental health crisis breathing space.
