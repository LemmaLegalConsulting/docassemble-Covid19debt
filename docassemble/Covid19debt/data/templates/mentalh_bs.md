#####What is a mental health breathing space: 

A mental health crisis breathing space is only available to someone who is receiving mental health crisis treatment.

Like the standard breathing space it can pause interest, fees, and collection of debts. It can also pause most action and contact from creditors.  

A mental health breathing space lasts as long as the person’s mental health crisis treatment, plus 30 days, no matter how long the crisis treatment lasts.

#####How to apply for a mental health breathing space: 

An Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP) **must certify** that you are receiving mental health crisis treatment. The AMHP’s evidence can be used by a debt adviser to start a mental health crisis breathing space.

The following people can apply to a debt adviser on behalf of a debtor for a mental health crisis breathing space:

-	any debtor receiving mental health
-	the debtor’s carer
-	Approved Mental Health Professionals
-	care coordinators appointed for the debtor
-	mental health nurses
-	social workers
-	independent mental health advocates or mental capacity advocates appointed for the debtor
-	a debtor’s representative

#####Eligibility for a mental health crisis breathing space:

You must still meet the same criteria and conditions for a standard breathing space. You  must also be receiving mental health crisis treatment at the time that an application is made.

If you had a standard or mental health crisis breathing space in the last 12 months you can be eligible for a mental health crisis breathing space.

There is no limit to how many times you can enter a mental health crisis breathing space.
