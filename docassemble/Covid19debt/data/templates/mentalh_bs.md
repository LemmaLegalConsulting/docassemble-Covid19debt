**What is a mental health breathing space: **

Like the standard breathing space it can pause interest, fees, and collection of debts. It can also pause most action and contact from creditors.  

A mental health crisis breathing space is only available to someone who is receiving mental health crisis treatment.

A mental health breathing space lasts as long as the person’s mental health crisis treatment, plus 30 days, no matter how long the crisis treatment lasts.

**How to apply for a mental health breathing space: **

An Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP) **must certify** that you are receiving mental health crisis treatment. The AMHP’s evidence can be used by a debt adviser to start a mental health crisis breathing space.

**Eligibility for a mental health crisis breathing space:**

You  must also be receiving mental health crisis treatment at the time that an application is made.

There is no limit to how many times you can enter a mental health crisis breathing space.
