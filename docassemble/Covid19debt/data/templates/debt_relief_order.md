A debt relief order (DRO) is one way to deal with your debts if you:

  - owe £30,000 or less
  
  - don’t own your own home
  
  - don’t have other assets or things of value
  
  - on’t have much spare income 
  
   You don't have to make payments towards most types of debt included in your DRO and your creditors can’t force you to pay off the debts. A DRO usually lasts **a year** unless your situation improves. When the DRO ends, most of your debts will be **written off**.
   
   **Debts covered by a DRO:**
    
   Debts that can go into a DRO are called ’qualifying debts'. During the DRO period creditors can’t ask you for payments, if they do, you don't have to pay them. They include:

credit cards, overdrafts and loans, arrears with rent, utility bills, telephone bills, council tax and income tax, benefits overpayments, hire purchase or conditional sale agreements, buy now - pay later agreements, bills for services like vets or solicitors, debts you owe to friends and family, business debts
   
   **Debts not covered by a DRO:**
   
   Not all debts are covered by a DRO. You'll still need to pay:

-magistrates court fines and confiscation orders relating to criminal activity

-child support and maintenance

-student loans

-social fund loans

-compensation for death and injury

**Is DRO right for you:**

  
  1. For DRO, the cost is relatively low(£90), you said **${cost_will}**
  
  2. DRO will affect your credit rating for 6 years, you said  **${credit_will}**

  3. it might affect applications you make for British citizenship - if you are unsure then you should get advice from an immigration specialist
  
  4. you can't borrow £500 or more without telling the creditor about the DRO, you can’t get involved in promoting, managing or setting up a limited company, or be a company director, without getting permission from the court
  
  **How to get a DRO?**
  
  You can only apply for a DRO through a specialist DRO adviser, also called an 'approved intermediary'. This is usually a skilled debt adviser who has been given permission to complete the forms and give advice on DROs. They will check that you're eligible to apply and that a DRO is right for you.
