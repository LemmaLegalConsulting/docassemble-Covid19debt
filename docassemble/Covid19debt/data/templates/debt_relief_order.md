A debt relief order is one way to deal with your debts if you:

  - Owe £30,000 or less
  
  - Do not own your own home
  
  - Do not have other assets or things of value
  
  - Do not have a lot of disposable income 
  
   You do not have to make payments towards most types of debt included in your debt relief order and your creditors can’t force you to pay off the debts. A debt relief order usually lasts **a year** unless your situation improves. When the debt relief order ends, most of your debts will be written off.

   Debts that can go into a debt relief order are called ’qualifying debts'. During the debt relief order period creditors can’t ask you for payments, if they do, you don't have to pay them.

They include:

  - overdrafts and loans,
  
  - rent arrers,
  
  - utility bills,
  
  - telephone bills,
  
  - council tax and income tax, 
  
  - benefits overpayments,
  - hire purchase or conditional sale agreements,
  
  - buy now - pay later agreements,
  
  - bills for services like vets or solicitors,
  
  - debts you owe to friends and family, business debts
   
   **Debts not covered by a debt relief order:**
   
   Not all debts are covered by a debt relief order. 
   
   You will  still need to pay:

  - Magistrates court fines and confiscation orders relating to criminal activity
  
  - Child support and maintenance
  
  - Student loans
  
  - Social fund loans
  
  - Compensation for death and injury

  **How to get a debt relief order?**
  
  You can only apply for a DRO through a specialist DRO adviser, also called an 'approved intermediary'. This is usually a skilled debt adviser who has been given permission to complete the forms and give advice on DROs. They will check that you're eligible to apply and that a DRO is right for you.
