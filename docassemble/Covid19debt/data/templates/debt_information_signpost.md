In this section we will ask you questions about your debts. 

For each debt we will ask one by one: 

- The type of debt, 
- Amount of your debts owed,
- The person or organization that you own debt to (the creditor),
- First missed payment date,
- If any action has been taken by the creditor,
- If there is a dispute about your debts.
