##### What is breathing space:

Government’s new breathing space period will freeze interest, fees and enforcement for people in problem debt, with further protections for those in mental health crisis treatment

###### The Debt Respite Scheme (Breathing Space) will give someone in problem debt the right to legal protections from their creditors.

A standard breathing space is available to anyone with problem debt. It gives them legal protections from creditor action for up to 60 days. The protections include pausing most enforcement action and contact from creditors and freezing most interest and charges on their debts.

##### How to Apply for a standard breathing space:

Debtors can only access a breathing space by seeking debt advice from a **debt adviser**.

Anyone who cannot or is unlikely to be able to repay their debts can apply to a debt adviser for a standard breathing space.

Although all applications must be considered, the debt adviser might decide a breathing space is not appropriate for a debtor.

For example, if a person can access funds or income, they might be able to pay their debts with some budgeting help. Another example would be if they already have assets that could easily be sold to clear the debt. In these cases, a breathing space would not be the right solution. A breathing space might also not be appropriate for a someone who can enter a more suitable debt solution straight away, without needing the protections.

##### Debtor eligibility for a standard breathing space:

Before a debt adviser can start the breathing space, they must confirm their client is eligible and meets all the conditions. 
  
  - be an individual
  - owe a qualifying debt to a creditor
  - live or usually reside in England or Wales
  - not have a debt relief order (DRO), an individual voluntary arrangement (IVA), an interim order, or be an undischarged bankrupt at the time they apply
  - not already have a breathing space or have had a standard breathing space in the last 12 months at the time they apply
  
##### What are Qualifying debts:

Debts included in a breathing space must be qualifying debts. Debts are any sum of money owed by the debtor to you, while liabilities are any obligation on the debtor to pay money to you. Most debts are likely to be qualifying debts. These will include:
- credit cards
- store cards
- personal loans
- pay day loans
- overdrafts
- utility bill arrears
- mortgage or rent arrears

The following debts are **excluded**:
 
 - secured debts (like mortgages, hire purchase or conditional sale agreements). 
 - debts incurred from fraud or fraudulent breach of trust. 
 - liabilities to pay fines imposed by a court for an offence. This includes any interest on the fine and any penalties connected to it. This does not include penalty charge notices, like a parking ticket
 - obligations from a confiscation order
 - a crisis or budgeting loan from the social fund
 - student loans
 - damages they need to pay for death or personal injury caused to someone else
 - advance payments of Universal Credit
 - council tax liabilities have not yet fallen due. If all instalments for that financial year have fallen due and have not been paid, these are considered to be a qualifying debt.
 
#####When a breathing space starts

A breathing space will start the day after the debtor’s details are put onto the breathing space register.

If you receive electronic notifications about the start of a breathing space, you should receive a notification the same day that details are put on the register. It’s likely this will be the day before the breathing space starts. If you receive notifications by post, it’s likely you’ll receive it after the breathing space has started.
