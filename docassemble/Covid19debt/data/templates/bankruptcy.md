Bankruptcy is a form of insolvency and is normally only suitable if you can’t pay back your debts in a reasonable time. When you go bankrupt almost all of your debts are written off. Deciding to go bankrupt is a big step that involves fees and can impact different areas of your life, such as your job or home.
  
**Advantages of going bankrupt:**

 1. When the bankruptcy order is over you can make a fresh start - in most cases this will be after a year.

 2. the pressure is taken off you because you don’t have to deal with your creditors
you're allowed to keep certain things known as 'exempt goods', for example everyday household items, tools you need to do your job, a car if you need it to get to work or you're a carer and it's not worth more than £2,000

 3. you're allowed to keep some of your income - but you'll probably have to live on less money than usual
 
 4. if you have to make payments from your income, this can only be for 3 years - you won’t have to make payments if your only income is from welfare benefits
 
 5. creditors have to stop most types of court action to get their money back following a bankruptcy order

 6. you won't have to pay back the debts that bankruptcy covers
